# Source normalization, four elementary identities from existing parent data

UNCOMPILED candidate; pinned branch work/chat-continuity, commit
16e24fe828a5a0002ef13bb82bae9e295f190f86.

Mathematical conclusion: after multiplying all quantities by stationary
wage^5, no 12th root is needed. These four proofs use original parent
scaling lemmas and the previously established capital-cost identity.
The OUTPUT identity remains a distinct root-of-degree-15 obligation;
it is NOT assumed to hold as a theorem by this file.
